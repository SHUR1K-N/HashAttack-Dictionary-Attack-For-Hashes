# HashNinja: A Dictionary Attack Tool for Hashes

## Description & Usage
A simple, yet quite useful and high-speed dictionary attack tool (700,000+ candidates per second), that attacks a supported hash with a user-defined dictionary file's candidates to find the string that matches with its corresponding hash.

## Supported Hashing Algorithms
- **BLAKE2b**
- **BLAKE2s**
- **MD5**
- **SHA-1**
- **SHA-2 (224-bit)**
- **SHA-2 (256-bit)**
- **SHA-2 (384-bit)**
- **SHA-2 (512-bit)**
- **SHA-3 (224-bit)**
- **SHA-3 (256-bit)**
- **SHA-3 (384-bit)**
- **SHA-3 (512-bit)**
- **SHAKE-128**
- **SHAKE-256**

## Hash Generator: String â†’ Hash Converter (for tests)
HashNinja also comes with a "Hash Generator" program that converts a user-input string to a hash of the selected hashing algorithm, and then automatically copies the generated hash to the clipboard; mainly for the purpose of testing HashNinja conveniently.

This project was created in Python, for experimental/observational purposes; and can also be aided with my own super fast numbered dictionary generator [**NumNinja**](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/NumNinja-Number-Dictionary-Generator)  (up to 2M+ lines per second) for numeric attacks.

## Optimization
The high password matching speed is owed to approach of "chunkifying" the dictionary file (creating multiple "chunks" of the dictionary) and then working on all those simplified chunks concurrently (multithreading) in different directions for better balance, efficiency and performance.
