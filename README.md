# HashAttack: A Dictionary Attack Tool for Hashes

## Description & Usage
A simple, yet quite useful and high-speed dictionary attack tool (700,000+ candidates per second), that attacks a hash with a user-defined dictionary file's candidates to find the string that matches with its corresponding hash.

- **SHA-1**
- **SHA-2 (224-bit)**
- **SHA-2 (256-bit)**
- **SHA-2 (384-bit)**

## Hash Generator: String â†’ Hash Converter (for tests)
HashAttack also comes with a "Hash Generator" program that converts a user-input string to a hash of the selected hashing algorithm, and then automatically copies the generated hash to the clipboard; mainly for the purpose of testing HashAttack conveniently.

This project was created in Python, for experimental/observational purposes; and can also be aided with my own super fast numbered dictionary generator [**NumNinja**](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/NumNinja-Number-Dictionary-Generator)  (2M+ lines per second) for numeric attacks.

## Dependencies to PIP-Install
- **colorama** (for colors)
- **termcolor** (for colors)
