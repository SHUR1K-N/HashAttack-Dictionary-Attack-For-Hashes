# HashAttack: A Dictionary Attack Tool for Hashes

## Description & Usage
A high speed dictionary attack implementation (700,000+ lines per second), that attacks hashes with a user-defined dictionary file's candidates to find the string that matches with the hash to be attacked.

Also comes with a Hash Generator program that converts a user-input string to a hash of the selected hashing algorithm, and then automatically copies the generated hash to the clipboard; mainly for the purpose of testing HashAttack conveniently.

This project was created in Python, for experimental/observational purposes; and can also be aided with my own super fast numbered dictionary generator [**NumNinja**](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/NumNinja-Number-Dictionary-Generator)  (2M+ lines per second) for numeric attacks.
